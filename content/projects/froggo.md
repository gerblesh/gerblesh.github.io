[Froggo Mode](https://gerblesh.itch.io/froggo-mode) was created by me and [Noah Adrichem](https://tenseven.nl) for the BigMode game jam, hosted by BigMode, a video game publishing company owned by the Youtuber VideoGameDunkey. The theme for the game jam was the word "mode," so we took the idea of having a little frog character transform into a bullet and an anvil in order to complete each level. In Froggo Mode, each "mode" or character contributes a necessary role for completing the levels. For instance, the anvil mode can crush the trash blocks in each level. Noah and I had some challenges communicating as our timezones were polar opposites. We learned to work collaboratively and finished the game before the jam ended. Players gave extremely positive feedback. We are now working on a full release to publish on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com)!

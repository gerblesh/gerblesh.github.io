title: "Vulkan Renderer in C"
---
Experiment to learn graphics APIs and low level platform libraries such as SDL. This project was quite grueling due to the sheer amount of verbosity vulkan requires, it took about 4-5 days until I saw any visible results (triangle). Things got easier once I had the foundation in place but it was certainly a learning experience in memory management, shaders, 3D projection, reading files in C, as well as vulkan itself.

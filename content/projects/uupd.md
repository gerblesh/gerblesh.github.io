I maintain [Universal Updater (uupd)](https://github.com/ublue-os/uupd), written in Go. It handles updates all of the subsystems of Universal Blue images ([Brew](https://brew.sh), [Distrobox](https://distrobox.it), etc) and [Bootc](https://github.com/bootc-dev/bootc)/[rpm-ostree](https://github.com/coreos/rpm-ostree), with progress reporting and a fancy CLI to boot. It is used as the automatic updater in several different desktop uBlue Images: [Bazzite](https://bazzite.gg), [Bluefin](https://projectbluefin.io/), [Aurora](https://getaurora.dev/). I triage issues from users and maintainers inside of the organization, review pull requests, and keep the software up to date and working.

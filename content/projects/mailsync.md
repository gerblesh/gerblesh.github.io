For my senior project at the Bush School, I worked with The Bush School IT to automate updating the parent mailing lists. Bush School currently uses Email Octopus to sent out emails to all the parents, however the mailing lists are managed externally with Blackbaud. Before my program, the mailing lists in Email Octopus needed to be manually updated which takes hours and was sparingly done. Now using my program, the lists are updated automatically every day without any extra effort required from IT, integrating with their current scheduling system. The program integrates with the Email Octopus API and a simple PostgresSQL database with the emails. It was built, deployed, and tested over the course of two weeks before summer 2025.

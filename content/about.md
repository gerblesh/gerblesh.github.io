Hi, I'm Gareth Widlansky, a passionate game developer, OSS contributor, and student at WPI. I am interested in game development, having completed several games and projects, I love every step of the process and getting deep into the rabbit holes it leads me down. I also maintain and contribute to OSS projects in my free time, most notable being Universal Blue.

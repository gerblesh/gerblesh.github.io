[![Froggo Mode](https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzE0MzU3OTc2LnBuZw==/original/THULbx.png)](https://gerblesh.itch.io/froggo-mode)
[Froggo Mode](https://gerblesh.itch.io/froggo-mode) was created by me and [Noah Adrichem](https://tenseven.nl) for the BigMode game jam, hosted by BigMode, a video game publishing company owned by the Youtuber VideoGameDunkey. The theme for the game jam was the word "mode," so we took the idea of having a little frog character transform into a bullet and an anvil in order to complete each level. In Froggo Mode, each "mode" or character contributes a necesary role for completing the levels. For instance, the anvil mode can crush the trash blocks in each level. Noah and I had some challenges communicating as our timezones were polar opposites. We learned to work collaboratively and finished the game before the jam ended. Players gave extremely positive feedback. We are now working on a full release to publish on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com)!

Taken from the Website:
> The Universal Blue project builds a diverse set of continuously delivered operating system images using Fedora Atomic Desktop's support for bootable OCI containers. That's nerdspeak for the ultimate Linux client: the reliability of a Chromebook, but with the flexibility and power of a traditional Linux desktop.
> These images represent what's possible when a community focuses on sharing best practices via automation and collaboration. One common language between dev and ops, and it's finally come to the desktop.
> We also provide tools for users to build their own image using our templates and processes, which can be used to ship custom configurations to all of your machines, or finally make the Linux distribution you've long wished for, but never had the tools to create.

I maintain the [Universal Blue Updater](https://github.com/ublue-os/ublue-update) which is used as the automatic updater in several different desktop uBlue Images: [Bazzite](https://bazzite.gg), [Bluefin](https://projectbluefin.io/), [Aurora](https://getaurora.dev/). I often collaborate and triage bugs with members of the organization, file github issues, and pull requests to projects within and adjecent to the [Universal Blue](https://universal-blue.org) Github organization

> The BlueBuild project creates accessible tools for you to create, configure & build custom images of atomic Fedora distributions.

This project originally started in [Universal Blue](https://universal-blue.org) as a starting point for creating custom images but eventually split off to become a seperate entity to manage the growing complexity of the image creation toolkit. I have contributed a lot to make the final iteration of [BlueBuild](https://blue-build.org) the way it is today, creating the systemd module, files module, signing module, and helping fix bugs that crop up. I used this project to create the operating system that I use on my laptop.

# [Bush Campus Signin](https://github.com/gar354/bush-campus-signin)
A simple webapp that allows students of the Bush School to sign in and out of campus digitally and store it in a google spreadsheet. Integrates with the google accounts system to ensure students are authenticated, runs locally on Bush Wifi to ensure students are on campus when signing in or out of school.

# [Shart2D](https://github.com/vincens2005/shart2d)
The name being a joking twist on the 2D physics engine "Box2D," shart2D was made in my free time with a friend as a way to experiment with C and raylib as well as getting to grips learning some basic physics and kinematics concepts. Rotational motion, friction, and rigid body collision all work well, only supports convex poligonal shapes (triangles, squares, hexagons, etc)

# [ShartVK](https://github.com/gerblesh/shartvk)
Experiment to learn graphics APIs and low level platform libraries such as SDL. This project was quite grueling due to the sheer amount of verbosity vulkan requires, it took about 4-5 days until I saw any visible results (triangle). Things got easier once I had the foundation in place but it was certainly a learning experience in memory management, shaders, 3D projection, reading files in C, as well as vulkan itself.

Taken from the Website:
> The Universal Blue project builds a diverse set of continuously delivered operating system images using Fedora Atomic Desktop's support for bootable OCI containers. That's nerdspeak for the ultimate Linux client: the reliability of a Chromebook, but with the flexibility and power of a traditional Linux desktop.
> These images represent what's possible when a community focuses on sharing best practices via automation and collaboration. One common language between dev and ops, and it's finally come to the desktop.
> We also provide tools for users to build their own image using our templates and processes, which can be used to ship custom configurations to all of your machines, or finally make the Linux distribution you've long wished for, but never had the tools to create.

I am the maintainer of the [Universal Blue Updater](https://github.com/ublue-os/ublue-update) which is used as the automatic updater in several different desktop uBlue Images: [Bazzite](https://bazzite.gg), [Bluefin](https://projectbluefin.io/), [Aurora](https://getaurora.dev/). I also collaborate, submit issues, and PRs to repositories within the Universal Blue Github organization

> The BlueBuild project creates accessible tools for you to create, configure & build custom images of atomic Fedora distributions.

This project originally started in Universal Blue as an image template but eventually split off to become a seperate entity to manage the growing complexity of image creation. I have contributed a lot to make the final iteration of startingpoint the way it is today, creating the systemd module, files module, signing module, and helping fix bugs that crop up. I use this project in order to build the operating system I use on my personal machines.

# [Froggo Mode](https://gerblesh.itch.io/froggo-mode)
Play as a cyborg frog that can change modes in order to get through difficult and puzzling challenges. Froggo Mode was originally created for the BigMode gamejam but is currently being developed for a full release available on steam.

# [Energy Exodus](https://gerblesh.itch.io/energy-exodus)
Made for the 1-bit jam with friends from school collaborating on code, art, and music, Energy Exodus is an exciting 2D platformer requiring precise movement and timing to beat. Play as a tiny robot in search of an escape, and hide from the enemies that get in your way!

# [Bush Campus Signin](https://github.com/gar354/bush-campus-signin)
A simple webapp that allows students of the Bush School to sign in and out of campus digitally and store it in a google spreadsheet. Integrates with the google accounts system to ensure students are authenticated, runs locally on bush wifi to ensure students are on campus when signing in or out of school.

# [Shart2D](https://github.com/vincens2005/shart2d)
The name being a joking twist on the 2D physics engine "Box2D," shart2D was made in my free time with a friend as a way to experiment with C and raylib as well as getting to grips learning some basic physics and kinematics concepts. Rotational motion, friction, and rigid body collision all work well, only supports convex poligonal shapes (triangles, squares, hexagons, etc)

# [ShartVK](https://github.com/gerblesh/shartvk)
Experiment to learn graphics APIs and low level platform libraries such as SDL. This project was quite grueling due to the sheer amount of verbosity vulkan requires, it took about 4-5 days until I saw any visible results (triangle). Things got easier once I had the foundation in place but it was certainly a learning experience in memory management, shaders, 3D projection, reading files in C, as well as vulkan itself.

Worked as an assistant teacher 1st Graders at Kimberly Elementary, helping with managing classroom behavior and teaching lessons. Taught the "Little Coders" Scratch curriculum and helped kids develop the logical thinking skills they use for coding. I also helped with pickup after class, managing the kids and making sure they get on the right bus or are picked up by the right parent.

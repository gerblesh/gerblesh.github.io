During highschool Spring and Fall 2025 semesters at Bush I TAed the AP Computer Science course, helping teach several lessons, review materials before quizzes and tests, and also helping students grapple with computer science concepts. Working with the computer science teacher was fun and it was really awesome to see all the kids grow in their skills throughout the year.

Taken from the Website:
> The BlueBuild project creates accessible tools for you to create, configure & build custom images of atomic Fedora distributions.

This project originally started in [Universal Blue](https://universal-blue.org) as a starting point for creating custom images but eventually split off to become a seperate entity to manage the growing complexity of the image creation toolkit. I have contributed a lot to make the final iteration of [BlueBuild](https://blue-build.org) the way it is today, creating the systemd module, files module, signing module, and helping fix bugs that crop up. I used this project to create the operating system that I use on my laptop.

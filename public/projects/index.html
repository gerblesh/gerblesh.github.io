The Universal Blue project builds a diverse set of continuously delivered operating system images using Fedora Atomic Desktop&rsquo;s support for bootable OCI containers. That&rsquo;s nerdspeak for the ultimate Linux client: the reliability of a Chromebook, but with the flexibility and power of a traditional Linux desktop.
These images represent what&rsquo;s possible when a community focuses on sharing best practices via automation and collaboration. One common language between dev and ops, and it&rsquo;s finally come to the desktop.
We also provide tools for users to build their own image using our templates and processes, which can be used to ship custom configurations to all of your machines, or finally make the Linux distribution you&rsquo;ve long wished for, but never had the tools to create.">

<p>This project originally started in Universal Blue as an image template but eventually split off to become a seperate entity to manage the growing complexity of image creation. I have contributed a lot to make the final iteration of startingpoint the way it is today, creating the systemd module, files module, signing module, and helping fix bugs that crop up. I use this project in order to build the operating system I use on my personal machines.</p>

<p>A simple webapp that allows students of the Bush School to sign in and out of campus digitally and store it in a google spreadsheet. Integrates with the google accounts system to ensure students are authenticated, runs locally on bush wifi to ensure students are on campus when signing in or out of school.</p>

<p>The name being a joking twist on the 2D physics engine &ldquo;Box2D,&rdquo; shart2D was made in my free time with a friend as a way to experiment with C and raylib as well as getting to grips learning some basic physics and kinematics concepts. Rotational motion, friction, and rigid body collision all work well, only supports convex poligonal shapes (triangles, squares, hexagons, etc)</p>

<p>Experiment to learn graphics APIs and low level platform libraries such as SDL. This project was quite grueling due to the sheer amount of verbosity vulkan requires, it took about 4-5 days until I saw any visible results (triangle). Things got easier once I had the foundation in place but it was certainly a learning experience in memory management, shaders, 3D projection, reading files in C, as well as vulkan itself.</p>
